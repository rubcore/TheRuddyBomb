# The Ruddy Bomb!

## Getting started

1) Install arudino ide
2) Install clion
3) Edit with clion and compile/deploy with arduino ide (don't forget to set it to read only in arudino ide)

### Note:

Clion will not work and CMake will not compile. This __is__ intended.

Our intention is that clion is only used as a editor, not a fully fledged IDE.

The only reason that CMake is checked is is for easier clion setup.
